Here goes the list of features per category 
Each row is a statement of a faulty class.

Spectrum-Based: 
	-Is stmt executed by a positive test case
	-Is stmt executed by a negative test case
	-Number of positive test cases that execute this stmt
	-Number of negative test cases that execute this stmt
	
Version-Control: (I'm listing several metrics, depending on our corpus we can get all or a subset of these)
	-Is pull request
	-Language
	-First commit created at
	-Team size
	-Source churn (Number of LOC changed by the commit)
	-Test churn (Number of test code changed by the commit)
	-Files added
	-Files deleted
	-Files modified
	-Tests added
	-Tests deleted
	-Tests modified
	-Number of commits which have modified the buggy class
	-Number of commits in the project
	-Is pushed by core team member
	-Number of words in the commit comment

Predicate-Based:

Static Analysis:

Naturalness:
	-Entropy (On the Naturalness of Software)
	-Probability score (Bugram: Bug Detection with N-gram Language 
	 Models) (similar to entropy but at statement level)
	-Probability score (Software Fault Localization Using N-gram Analysis) (similar to
	 entropy but at block level)

Code Metrics:
	Basic:
	-Lines of code in the project/buggy class
	-Lines/Branch coverage of the project/buggy class when running the test suite
	-Number of source files
	-Number of doc files
	-Number of total files (source+doc+others)
	-Number of asserts
	-Bugs per line of code
	-Comment density
	-Program size (size of the binary representation of the program, .class files only)

	Optional:
	-Cohesion
	-Coupling
	-Connascence metrics (If you change one component you need to change another for the program to work)
	-Cyclomatic complexity (Number of linearly independent paths) (Maybe straightforward to get when 
	 getting the naturalness metrics)
	-Social metrics (Github stars, etc)
	-Halstead complexity metrics ("Expression of the code")
  
Slicing:

Syntactic:
	-Statement kind
	-Parent statement kind
	-Number of levels deep the statement is on (how many open parenthesis before getting to the stmt)
	-Length
	-Location in parent
